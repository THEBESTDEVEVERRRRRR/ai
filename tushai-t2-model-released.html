    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8 text-center">Published on: September 2, 2025</p>

    <section class="blog-content">
        <p>TushAI is proud to announce the release of our next model in both normal and advanced models. The TushAI T2, TushAI T2 Pro released for everyone and TushAI T2 Ultra has been released for pro users. </p>

        <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4" >TushAI T2</h2>
        <p>We have developed a successor to the T1 series by making this new series. Currently already released for everyone. The TushAI T2 according to benchmarks done by TushAI internal labs is shows massive performance improvements in AI benchmarks beating competitors. Trained on terabytes of ethically sourced data and with thousands of GPUs, this model is designed to understand and generate human-like text with greater accuracy and relevance without compromising the privacy of our users.</p>

        <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4" >TushAI T2 Pro & Ultra</h2>
        <p>One of the limitations listed in the TushAI T1 release page is the limited knowledge in pop culture. We realised one of the ways to overcome this limitations is to implement a search feature to the TushAI T2 model which can provide the AI model with current information and assist the AI model to get the information and knowledge about a certain question. This model has been tested and the results shows that this new model has a wider range of knowledge about pop culture and things that the current model has limitations on.</p>

        <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4" >AISuperMind for TushAI T2 Ultra</h2>
        <p> We also released the AISupermind for the Ultra model for smarter responses. AISuperMind is an advanced feature that leverages the power of the T2 Ultra model and multiple GPUs to provide more accurate and context-aware responses. By utilizing a combination of real-time data and enhanced reasoning capabilities, AISuperMind aims to deliver a truly next-level AI experience.</p>

        <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4" >Core Values</h2>
        <p>Our commitment to ethical AI is a core value when we developed these AI. When we are developing these AI, we put these core values as our priority. We also keep our promises for a private AI when you use these models now.</p>

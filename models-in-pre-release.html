    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8 text-center">Published on: April 5, 2025</p>

    <section class="blog-content">
        <p>TushAI is proud to announce the pre-release of our next model in both beta and alpha phase. The TushAI T1 search and TushAI T1.1 has been released for pro users. </p>

        <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4" >TushAI T1.1</h2>
        <p>We are developing a successor to the T1 series by making this new series. Currently development stage is still in Alpha. The TushAI T1.1 according to benchmarks done by TushAI internal labs is showing massive performance improvements in AI benchmarks beating competitors. Currently the TushAI T1.1 is still on the alpha stage because of the model which is not fully refined which at this current stage, is showing flaws in speed and has some rate limits.</p>

        <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4" >TushAI T1 Search</h2>
        <p>One of the limitations listed in the TushAI T1 release page is the limited knowledge in pop culture. We realised one of the ways to overcome this limitations is to implement a search feature to the TushAI T1 model which can provide the AI model with current information and assist the AI model to get the information and knowledge about a certain question. This model has been tested and the results shows that this new model has a wider range of knowledge about pop culture and things that the current model has limitations on. This AI model is only currently in Beta because the search feature of this AI is slightly resource intensive. We are working to use the compute resource more efficiently when using the search feature before releasing this model for free users.</p>

        <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4" >Estimation of Release</h2>
        <p>We don't have a exact release date of these AI models but estimates for Tush T1 Search is before July and for the TushAI T1.1 is this year but we do not have a more precise estimate.</p>

        <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4" >Core Values</h2>
        <p>Our commitment to ethical AI is a core value when we developed these AI. When we are developing these AI, we put these core values as our priority. We also keep our promises for a private AI when you use these models now.</p>

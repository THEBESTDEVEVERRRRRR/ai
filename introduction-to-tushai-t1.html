  <p class="text-gray-400 mb-8 text-center">Published on: March 26, 2025</p>

  <section class="blog-content">
    <p>Welcome to the first post on the TushAI blog! We're thrilled to announce that we are releasing an AI model made, trained, and refined by TushAI team.</p>

    <h2 class=" text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Introduction to TushAI T1</h2>
    <p>TushAI T1 is our most advanced model for complex tasks. It tops the LMArena leaderboard — which measures human preferences — by a significant margin, indicating a highly capable model equipped with high-quality style. The T1 Reasoning model also shows strong reasoning and code capabilities, leading on common coding, math and science benchmarks.

      TushAI T1 and its other derivatives are available now in TushAI Website for free. We’ll also introduce a more refined website in the coming weeks, enabling people to use TushAI T1 at its fullest potential.</p>
